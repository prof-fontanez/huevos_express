# huevos_express
Simple React.js page to provide a storefront for an semi-ambulatory egg-selling business.

## Overview
This site is built to showcase product photos for a small business. It features a React frontend with a MySQL backend might support filtering images.

This project is currently private and for internal use only, since I am, and most likely will be, the sole contributor.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js, Material UI
- Backend: Node.js (using Express) (soon)
- Database: MySQL (soon)

## License
Private project. Not licensed for public or commercial use.

## Notes / To-Do
- Add image upload functionality
- Separate folders for client and server code (with modification of start process to start client and server simultaneously)
- Implement user authentication for admin panel
- Implement portal to update prices from admin panel
- Implement some form of real-time update if prices change (could be polling, but would prefer a more dynamic way for this)
